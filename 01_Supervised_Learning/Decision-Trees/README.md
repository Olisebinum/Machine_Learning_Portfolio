# 🌳 Decision Trees Project — *Olise Ebinum*

## 📘 Overview  
This project demonstrates my ability to implement and interpret **Decision Tree models** for both **classification** and **regression** tasks using Python.  
The notebook guides through the complete machine learning workflow — from **data exploration** to **model evaluation** — to understand how features influence the target variable and how the tree-based structure makes predictions.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow  

### 🔍 1. Data Exploration & Preprocessing  
- Loaded datasets using **Pandas** and **NumPy**  
- Explored data structure, summary statistics, and missing values  
- Visualized relationships using:  
  - 📊 Pairplots  
  - 🔥 Correlation Heatmaps  
  - 🌿 Feature distribution plots  
- Cleaned, encoded, and standardized features for modeling  
- Handled categorical variables with **One-Hot Encoding** or **Label Encoding**  

---

### 🧠 2. Model Development  
- Built **Decision Tree Classifier & Regressor** models using `scikit-learn`  
- Split dataset into **training** and **test sets**  
- Tuned key hyperparameters:  
  - `max_depth`  
  - `min_samples_split`  
  - `min_samples_leaf`  
  - `criterion` (Gini/Entropy for classification, MSE for regression)  
- Visualized the tree structure using `plot_tree` for interpretability  

---

### 📊 3. Model Evaluation & Diagnostics  
Evaluated model performance using metrics relevant to the task:  

**Classification Metrics:**  
- Accuracy ✅  
- Precision & Recall ⚖️  
- F1 Score 🏆  
- Confusion Matrix 🔢  

**Regression Metrics:**  
- R² Score 📈  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) / Root MSE 📉  

Additional diagnostic checks:  
- Feature importance analysis 🌟  
- Overfitting/underfitting assessment via train/test performance comparison  
- Tree pruning strategies to improve generalization  

---

### 💡 4. Insights & Interpretation  
- Identified the most influential features driving predictions  
- Interpreted decision paths for key predictions  
- Analyzed potential overfitting and suggested regularization techniques  
- Recommended improvements like:  
  - Ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)  
  - Feature engineering for better predictive power
