# 📌 **1. Project Overview**

This project applies **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** to understand how several independent variables collectively influence a continuous outcome.  
The notebook demonstrates a full machine learning workflow — from data preparation and exploratory analysis to model building, evaluation, and interpretation.

---

# 🔍 **2. Problem Statement**

The goal of this analysis was to build a multiple regression model capable of:

- Identifying significant predictors  
- Measuring the strength and direction of their effects  
- Determining how well the model explains variations in the target  
- Validating that regression assumptions hold  

The project focuses on both **predictive performance** and **statistical understanding**.

# 🧩 **3. Workflow Summary**

## 🧪 **A. Data Preprocessing**
Steps included:

- Loading dataset using **Pandas** and **NumPy**  
- Inspecting missing values, data types, and summary statistics  
- Handling outliers or unusual observations  
- Preparing features (transformation, scaling, or encoding where needed)

✔ Ensured a clean and structured dataset ready for modeling.

---

## 📊 **B. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

To understand dataset structure and relationships, the analysis used:

- 🔥 **Correlation heatmaps**  
- 📉 **Scatter plots** and trend lines  
- 🧮 **Descriptive statistics**  
- 📊 **Visual distribution checks**  

✔ Helped identify potential predictors and detect multicollinearity.

---

## 🧠 **C. Model Development**

Using **Scikit-learn’s `LinearRegression`**, the model was created by:

- Splitting the dataset into training and test sets  
- Fitting the MLR model using multiple features  
- Extracting:
  - Coefficients (effect sizes of each variable)  
  - Intercept  
  - Feature contributions to the model  

✔ Built a predictive model capable of quantifying relationships across many variables.

## 📈 **D. Model Evaluation**

Performance was assessed using key regression metrics:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **R² Score** | Measures how much variance is explained by the model |
| **Adjusted R²** | Accounts for the number of predictors |
| **MSE / RMSE** | Indicates average prediction error |
| **Residual Plots** | Confirms validity of regression assumptions |

Additional diagnostic checks:

- Normality of residuals (QQ plots)  
- Homoscedasticity (constant variance)  
- Independence of errors  
- Linearity between predictors and target  

✔ Ensured reliable interpretation and trustworthy model behavior.

---

## 🧠 **E. Interpretation of Results**

The model output was translated into clear explanations:

- Which variables have positive or negative influence  
- How strongly each predictor affects the target  
- Signs of multicollinearity or unstable coefficients  
- How well the regression line fits the observed data  
- Limitations and areas for improvement  

✔ Provided meaningful conclusions rather than just numerical output.
