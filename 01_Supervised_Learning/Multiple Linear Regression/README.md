# 📈 Multiple Linear Regression Project — *Olise Ebinum*

## 📘 Overview  
This project demonstrates my ability to implement and interpret a **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** model using Python.  
The notebook walks through the complete machine learning workflow — from **data exploration** to **model diagnostics** — to understand how multiple independent variables collectively influence a target outcome.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow  

### 🔍 1. Data Exploration & Preprocessing  
- Loaded the dataset using **Pandas** and **NumPy**  
- Explored data structure, summary statistics, and missing values  
- Visualized relationships using:  
  - 📊 Pairplots  
  - 🔥 Correlation Heatmaps  
  - 📉 Scatter Plots  
- Cleaned, encoded, and standardized features for modeling  

---

### 🧠 2. Model Development  
- Built a **Multiple Linear Regression** model using `scikit-learn`  
- Split dataset into training and test sets  
- Extracted:  
  - ⚫ Intercept  
  - ⚪ Coefficient weights  
- Made predictions and compared them with actual values  

---

### 📊 3. Model Evaluation & Diagnostics  
Evaluated the model using key regression metrics:  
- **R² Score**  
- **Adjusted R²**  
- **MSE / RMSE**  
- **Residual Analysis**, including:  
  - Residual scatter plots  
  - QQ plots (normality check)  
  - Homoscedasticity checks  

These diagnostics helped assess:  
- Linearity  
- Normal distribution of errors  
- Variance consistency  
- Multicollinearity  

---

### 💡 4. Insights & Interpretation  
- Identified predictors with the largest influence on the target variable  
- Explained coefficient direction (positive/negative effects)  
- Discussed any multicollinearity and its implications  
- Suggested improvements like feature engineering or regularization
