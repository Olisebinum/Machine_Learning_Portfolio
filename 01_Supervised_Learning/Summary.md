# 🧠 Linear Regression Code Challenge — Olise Ebinum

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to apply **supervised machine learning techniques**—specifically, **Linear Regression**—to solve real-world predictive problems.  
The challenge required end-to-end implementation: from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation and interpretation of statistical insights.  

The goal was not only to build an accurate regression model but also to **understand the story behind the data**, validate model assumptions, and communicate findings in a clear, data-driven manner.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

### 1. 🧩 **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**
- Imported and explored dataset using **Pandas** and **NumPy**.  
- Checked for null values, data types, and statistical summaries.  
- Visualized correlations between predictors and target variables using **Seaborn heatmaps** and **Matplotlib scatter plots**.  
- Standardized and prepared features for modeling.  

### 2. 🧠 **Model Development**
- Implemented **Linear Regression** using `scikit-learn`.  
- Split the dataset into training and test subsets for model validation.  
- Extracted the **slope** and **intercept** to understand feature influence on the target variable.  
- Made predictions and compared them against actual values to assess model accuracy.  

### 3. 📊 **Model Evaluation & Diagnostics**
- Calculated key regression metrics:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
  - **R² (Coefficient of Determination)**  
- Analyzed **residuals distribution** to assess model fit and randomness.  
- Interpreted results to confirm linearity assumptions and identify potential sources of variance.

### 4. 💡 **Insights & Interpretation**
- Highlighted the strength and direction of the relationship between predictors and outcomes.  
- Provided clear explanations of how changes in independent variables impact predictions.  
- Discussed implications of residual variability and model limitations for future optimization.
